      <h5 className="mt-0 mb-1">ChatGPT is losing users by the hundreds, everyday. However, OpenAI is not worried</h5>
      ChatGPT's website traffic is down by 10 per cent from last month. However, OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT are not worried at all. This is because their core paying customers, still use their API and their LLM, the GPT-4.
      OpenAI’s highly popular ChatGPT has experienced a decline in user numbers for the first time since its launch, The Washington Post has reported. This development raises the possibility that the AI chatbot’s popularity may have reached its peak.
